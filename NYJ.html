    <p>to the Xhosa tribe. After her parent's divorce and her father goes to live with his sec</p>
    <p>ond wife and new family, Patricia grows up feeling neglected as the middle child of a wo</p>
    <p>rking-class single mother.Although she hope to return to live with her father, she ends </p>
    <p>up being sent to live with her parental aunt in a impoverished rural area. Patricia gives</p> 
    <p>birth to Trevor, a light-skinned mixed-race child. It is illegal in Soouth Africa for peo</p>
    <p>le to have sex with individual from different  racial classification. Trevor  is evidence</p> 
    <p>of her criminal activtity. Both Patricia and Robert have to make sure that they hide their</p>
    <p>relationship to Trevor for fear of being arrested. Patricia encourages Trevior to be a cur</p>
    <p>ious and independent thinkerwho reflects critically, asks a lot of question and thinks for</p>
    <p>himself. Patricia had to becrafty to avoid question about Trevors lighter skin as it was i</p>
    <p>llegal for him to exit. The risk of being sighted in public with their son was too high for</p>
    <p>Trevor's paraents consequently, when Trevior visited Patricia's family in Soweto, his grand</p>
    <p>mother barred him from playing outdoors with his cousins for fear of being arrested. Trevior</p>
    <p>learned to amuse himself indoor.Eventually, Trevor met bircia South Africans who had escaped</p>
    <p>the county before the election of Nelson Mandela.Patricia, in response to Trevor'squestion</p> 
    <p>about why she hadn't taken him to another country like  Switzerland said she had no desire to</p>
    <p>leave her homeland, South Afriuca.
